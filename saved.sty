how to github basics :
To upload your project to GitHub from the command line in VS Code, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- Install **Git** on your system if you haven't already.
- Create a **GitHub account** and a new repository for your project.
- Set up **SSH keys** (optional but recommended for secure access without passwords).

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### 1. **Open VS Code and Initialize Git**
- Open your project folder in VS Code.
- Open the **Terminal** in VS Code (`Ctrl + `).
- Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized):
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

#### 2. **Stage Your Files**
- Add all the files in your project to the staging area:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    - The `.` stages all files. You can also specify individual files by name.

#### 3. **Commit the Changes**
- Commit your staged changes with a meaningful commit message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

#### 4. **Create a New GitHub Repository**
- Go to GitHub and create a **new repository**.
    - Name it something relevant to your project.
    - You can choose to initialize it with a README or leave it empty.

#### 5. **Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub**
- Copy the **URL** of the new GitHub repository (HTTPS or SSH).
- Link your local project to the GitHub repository using this command:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
    ```
    - Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the copied repository URL.

#### 6. **Push Your Project to GitHub**
- Push your changes to GitHub using the following command:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin master
    ```
    - The `-u` flag sets the `origin` remote and `master` branch for future pushes.

#### 7. **Check Your Repository on GitHub**
- Go to your GitHub repository URL, and you should see your project files uploaded.

### Additional Commands:
- **To push changes after making new commits**:
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

- **To pull updates from the repository** (if you or others make changes on GitHub):
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
